Okay, so last weekend, I decided to give AWS the full attention of mine and get a Solutions Architect - Associate certification.

Why, you may ask? Well, I do know the basics of AWS but I think it's high time to get a certification to showcase the skill. Not only I will have something to brag about, but then, I will get good insights on understanding the nitty gritty of the cloud services provided by Amazon.
